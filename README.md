Just a small repository which allows you to create an audio book library and share it across your Local Area Network.
It's also a great tool for students.

BasicServer.py is the web interface, therefore you will need a device which will be the server and a local area network(LAN).
step 1: Download the scripts
step 2: Create a "audiobooklib" folder
step 3: Run the server script when you want to share your mp3 audiobooks
